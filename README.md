# The-single-machine-total-weighted-tardiness-problem
The single machine total weighted tardiness problem (SMTWTP) is a
well-known NP-hard scheduling problem. There are n jobs to be scheduled
on a single machine that can handle only one job at a time. Each of n
jobs (numbered 1, . . . , n) is to be processed without interruption.
Job *i* ∈ *n* becomes available for processing at time zero, requires an
integer processing time *p*<sub>*i*</sub>, and has a positive weight
*w*<sub>*i*</sub> and a due date *d*<sub>*i*</sub>.  
For a given processing order of the jobs, the (earliest) completion time
*C*<sub>*i*</sub> and the tardiness
*T*<sub>*i*</sub> = *m**a**x*{*C*<sub>*i*</sub> − *d*<sub>*i*</sub>, 0}
of job *i* ∈ (*i* = 1, ..., *n*) can be computed. The objective is to
find a processing order of the jobs that minimizes the total weighted
tardiness:
*m**i**n*∑<sub>*i*</sub>*w*<sub>*i*</sub> × *T*<sub>*i*</sub>.

## [FirstDescent Algorithm](https://github.com/taylankabbani/The-single-machine-total-weighted-tardiness-problem/blob/master/FirstDescent_algorithm.py)

The developed local search algorithm to solve SMTWTP is described as
follows. The solution presentation is the permutation of n numbers of
the jobs to be done in the set {1, 2,..., n}, where the
*i*<sup>*th*</sup> number in the permutation denotes that the job is
the *i*<sup>*th*</sup> job to be processed. For example, a sequence of
5-job schedules, 5-3-1-2-4 is simply represented as {5,3,1,2,4}. The
initial solution is generated by producing a random schedule of jobs,
and the set of neighboring solutions N(X) is sampled by swap at random
*i*<sup>*th*</sup> and *j*<sup>*th*</sup> number of the current
solution. The first improvement (first descent) strategy move is
applied. The stopping criteria is set to 100 iteration without finding
an improving solution.

## [Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm](https://github.com/taylankabbani/The-single-machine-total-weighted-tardiness-problem/blob/master/SA_Algorithm.py)
The swap move is used to develop a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm with the following
temperature = 1000, geometric cooling schedule with a cooling rate of 0.99, epoch len
criteria as the temperature achieves a very small value (e.g., 0.001).
SA algorithm is a stochastic algorithm; therefore, in order to evaluate its performance, the
along with the best and worse performance is being reported for each problem instance.
